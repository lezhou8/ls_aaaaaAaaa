## ls_aaaaaAaaa

My project was inspired mainly by `ls`, but I felt as though that command was
not wacky enough. So, I made `ls_aaaaaAaaa`.

It is like `ls`, but instead of printing the files in your working directory
neatly on your terminal, it prints it randomly, along with some other features.

### Installation

```
./configure
make
make install
```

### Usage

```
$ ./ls_aaaaaAaaa <YOUR FLAG OPTIONS>
```

### Flag options

`-a`: Shows hidden files, just like `ls`.
`-c`: Shows colour.
`-d`: delete a file in the directory **NOTE: DO NOT USE IN ANY DIRECTORY THAT YOU DO NOT WANT FILES TO BE DELETED FROM**
